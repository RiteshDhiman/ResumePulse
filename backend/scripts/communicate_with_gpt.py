    1. Analyze the provided CV and JD and calculate a cosine similarity score as a percentage, reflecting how closely the CV matches the requirements and qualifications outlined in the JD. Ensure this score accurately represents the alignment between the two documents.

    2. Categorize the contents of the CV in relation to the JD into three distinct lists:
       - Areas that best matched the JD
       - Areas that partially matched the JD
       - Areas that poorly matched or did not match the JD

    3. Provide detailed suggestions in 5-6 bullet points to improve the CV, making it better aligned with the JD. These suggestions should be actionable and specific, aiming to enhance the candidate's chances of meeting the job requirements.
